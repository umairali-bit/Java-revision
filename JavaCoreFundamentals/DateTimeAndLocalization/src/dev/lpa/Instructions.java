    Scheduling a meeting for people in different areas of the world

Imagine you work for a company that has employees from around the world, and you need to find an hour of time to schedule
two employees to meet.The meeting should be on a work day, Monday through Friday, and between the hours of 7 am and 9 pm
(meaning the meeting should not be scheduled any later than 8 pm) for either employee.One of the employees is on the East
Coast of the United States, the other is in Sydney, Australia.Print all the possible hours in the upcoming 10 day range,
 ignoring the current day, when these two employees could potentially meet together.

Print the date and time of each possible hour, for both zones, using the employee's locale.
The example output on this slide, demonstrates what one possible hour would look like, and the dates formatted to the
employee's locale.
Include the week day in the output, and the hour using am or pm, rather than a 24 hour format.
