Each student will have a course engagement instance, for every course they're enrolled in.
It should have the fields for the course, the enrollment date, the engagement type, the last lecture, and the last activity date.
It should have the usual getters, plus getters for calculated fields as shown here.
The getMonthsSinceActive method should return the months elapsed, since the last course activity.
